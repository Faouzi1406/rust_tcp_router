## Getting Started

There is a lib_version branch, this branch contains the library version of the implementations used in the main.rs file. 
All you have to do is put this in your Cargo.toml file: 

```Rust 
router = { git = "https://github.com/Faouzi1406/rust_tcp_router", branch="lib_version" }
```

After that you will just need to create the TCP server and then you can use this library for routing and use the html rendering engine.

### Prerequisites

You will need Rust installed for this:

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```
